---

## üéØ Project Overview

**KnowledgeBot** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI assistant that enables intelligent question-answering over custom document collections. This project represents the culmination of Module 1 in the Ready Tensor Agentic AI Developer Certification Program (AAIDC), demonstrating foundational concepts of agentic AI through practical implementation.

### What Makes This Special

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, KnowledgeBot creates specialized knowledge domains by:

- **Crawling and indexing** web content or Wikipedia articles into a vector database
- **Performing semantic search** to find relevant context for user questions  
- **Generating informed responses** using local LLMs with retrieved context
- **Maintaining source transparency** by showing which documents informed each answer

### üéì Educational Context

This project serves as the first practical deliverable in the AAIDC program, where participants learn to build production-ready agentic AI systems. The implementation showcases:

- **RAG Pipeline Architecture**: Prompt formulation ‚Üí Vector retrieval ‚Üí LLM response generation
- **Local AI Infrastructure**: Self-hosted LLMs and vector databases for privacy and control
- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings for intelligent content retrieval
- **Full-Stack Integration**: From data ingestion to user-facing interfaces

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

KnowledgeBot implements a modern RAG architecture with the following components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web Crawler] -->|Chunks & Embeds| B[Qdrant Vector DB]
    C[User Question] -->|Convert to Vector| D[Semantic Search]
    D -->|Retrieve Context| B
    D -->|Question + Context| E[Local LLM via Ollama]
    E -->|Generated Answer| F[Web UI Response]
    B -->|Source References| F
```

### Core Components

- **üï∑Ô∏è Web Crawler**: Go-based crawler that processes web content, converts HTML to markdown, and chunks text for optimal vector storage
- **üóÑÔ∏è Vector Database**: Qdrant for fast semantic search with cosine similarity
- **üß† Local LLM**: Ollama running models like `qwen2.5:3b` for response generation
- **üåê Web Interface**: Clean, responsive UI for natural question-answering
- **üì° API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with [Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Minimum 8GB RAM (more recommended for larger models)
- 5GB+ free disk space
- Internet connection for initial model downloads

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and Start Services**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledgebot.git
cd knowledgebot
make compose-up
```

2. **Download Required Models**

```bash
make pull-models
```

*Note: Model download may take 5+ minutes depending on connection speed*

3. **Index Your First Knowledge Domain**

```bash
# Example: Crawl Futurama Wikipedia content
make crawl-wikipedia-futurama

# Or crawl any website
make crawl URL=https://example.com MAX_DEPTH=2
```

4. **Start Asking Questions!**

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and try asking:

- "What are the main Futurama characters?"
- "Tell me about Professor Farnsworth"
- "How does the Planet Express ship work?"

---

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Web Interface

The primary interface provides an intuitive chat experience:

- **Real-time Streaming**: Responses stream as they're generated
- **Source Attribution**: Each answer shows which documents were used
- **Context Snippets**: Preview the exact text passages that informed the response

### API Integration

For programmatic access:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/qna?q=What%20are%20the%20main%20Futurama%20characters?"
```

The API returns Server-Sent Events with structured JSON:

```json
{"sources": [{"url": "...", "title": "...", "snippets": [...]}]}
{"chunk": "The main characters in Futurama include..."}
```

### Custom Domain Creation

Create specialized knowledge bases for any topic:

```bash
# Academic research domain
make crawl URL=https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent MAX_DEPTH=2

# Product documentation
make crawl URL=https://docs.python.org/3/ MAX_DEPTH=3

# Company knowledge base
make crawl URL=https://your-company.com/docs MAX_DEPTH=2
```

---

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Environment Variables

Key configuration options (see `.env_example`):

```bash
KLB_OPENAI_URL=http://ollama:11434    # LLM service endpoint
KLB_OPENAI_KEY=ollama                 # API key for LLM service
```

### Model Selection

Easily swap LLM models by modifying `cmd/knowledgebot/serve.go`:

- **qwen2.5:3b** (default) - Balanced performance and resource usage
- **llama2:7b** - Higher quality responses, more resource intensive
- **codellama:7b** - Specialized for technical/programming questions

### Crawling Parameters

Fine-tune content ingestion:

- `--max-depth`: How deep to follow links (default: 1)
- `--url-regex`: Filter URLs with regex patterns
- `--score-threshold`: Minimum similarity score for search results

---

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### RAG Pipeline Deep Dive

**1. Document Ingestion**

- HTML content converted to clean markdown using `html-to-markdown`
- Text chunked into 768-character segments with 175-character overlap
- Each chunk embedded using `all-minilm` model (384 dimensions)
- Metadata preserved (URL, title, content) for source attribution

**2. Semantic Retrieval**

- User questions converted to vectors using same embedding model
- Cosine similarity search in Qdrant with configurable thresholds
- Up to 15 most relevant chunks retrieved per query
- Results ranked by relevance score

**3. Response Generation**

- Retrieved context combined with system prompt template
- Local LLM generates responses without sending data to external services
- Streaming output provides real-time user feedback
- Source references maintained throughout the pipeline

### Performance Characteristics

- **Search Latency**: <100ms for similarity queries
- **Response Time**: 2-30 seconds depending on question complexity and hardware
- **Scalability**: Supports thousands of documents per collection
- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally - no data leaves your infrastructure

**Qdrant Vector Database**: Selected for its production-ready vector search capabilities, efficient storage, and excellent Go client library support.

**Ollama for LLM Serving**: Provides a Docker-friendly way to run local models with consistent APIs, avoiding external dependencies and ensuring data privacy.

**Local-First Architecture**: Ensures all user data and queries remain on the user's infrastructure, addressing privacy concerns common in enterprise environments.

### Performance Optimizations

- **Chunk Deduplication**: SHA256 hashing prevents duplicate content indexing
- **Concurrent Crawling**: Goroutines enable efficient parallel web scraping
- **Streaming Responses**: Server-Sent Events provide immediate user feedback
