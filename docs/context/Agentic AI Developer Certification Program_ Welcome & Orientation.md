# 💡 Why We Created This Program

This program was born from demand. After launching our global Agentic AI competition and seeing 700+ incredible submissions, we heard one question over and over:

> "How do I actually get started with Agentic AI?"

We created this program to answer that question, and to invite you to help build the very tools we're working on ourselves.

🎥 **Watch this video** to learn what inspired the program and how it fits into our broader vision at Ready Tensor.

# 🛠️ How the Program Works (And How to Get the Most Out of It)

This isn't a lecture-first course. Instead, we give you projects, then let you figure things out, just like you would on the job.

You'll have weekly content drops to guide you, but you're free to learn at your own pace and in your own style. The goal is to **build**, not just watch and read.

Here's how the weekly flow works:

- 📅 **Lectures for the week** will be posted **before Monday**
- 🎥 **Lecture videos** will be up by **Tuesday**
- ❓ **Q/A video** (answering common questions from the previous week) also drops on **Tuesdays**

## Important note:

The **videos won't walk you through the lectures line by line**. Instead, we'll highlight what to focus on, point out common pitfalls, and raise key questions to think about.
We're not here to spoon-feed you. We're here to guide you, like a manager would guide their team.

So here's our recommendation:

- Start with the project description
- Finalize your project idea and team
- Make a plan and divide the work
- Learn what you need to get the job done
- Use the lectures, tools, or any other resource you prefer
- And just **build something great**

🎥 **Watch this video** for a quick overview of how to approach the program and make the most of it.
